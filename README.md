## Description
Designed a V4 Diesel Engine parts using mechanical calculations based on the below stated problem and data

**Raw Data**
* Brake power = 5kW
* Speed = 1500 rpm with permissible speed of 2500 rpm
* Mean effective pressure = 0.35 MPa
* Mechanical efficiency = 85%
* Fuel consumption = 250 g/kWhr
* Maximum gas pressure = 3.5 MPa
* Mass of reciprocating parts = 10 N
* Length of connecting rod = 300 mm
* Compression ratio = 8:1
* Maximum torque at 35 degree crank angle with gas pressure of 3.5 MPa
* High calorific value of diesel = 43,000 KJ/kg
* Weight of pulley = 200 N
* Pulley load = 25 N
* Factor of safety = 3
